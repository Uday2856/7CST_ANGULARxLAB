# 7CST_ANGULARxLAB

👨‍💻 **Uday's Angular Lab Archive**  
**Semester:** 7th CST | **Course:** ANGULAR LAB (AR(P))  
**Format:** Only `.txt` files because I’m not here to impress GitHub with flashy folders.

## 😎 What *This* Is (And What It Isn't)

This is **my personal dump zone**. Yep — one stop archive of my Angular lab work.
- For me.
- By me.
- Maintained while procrastinating harder than my deadlines.

This ain’t a complete Angular project repo. 
This isn’t a full-fledged clone-and-run setup either.

What you’ll find here is **brutally straightforward `.txt` files**, containing:
- The **entire logic/code** for each lab experiment
- Structured in a way that helps me **write records** without flipping VS Code during exam week

No promises of prettiness, just raw code and sarcasm.✨

## 🚨 Copy-Paste Warning (Yeah, You)

Let’s be real: 
You’re probably here looking to copy stuff. And I get it.
But here’s the deal:

> **This archive is NOT built for blind copy-paste.**

It’s here for:
- Code referencing (aka controlled copying)
- Record documentation
- Internal & external *survival*
- Remembering what I even wrote a week ago

So if you’re just Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V-ing without understanding a thing, don’t cry if your viva crashes harder than Angular CLI.

## 📂 What’s Inside (So Far)

Currently, only the **important directories have `.txt` files** — and they contain:
- Clean, formatted code
- Minimal explanations (I’ll do comments when I retire maybe)
- Enough to build your own experiments without starting from scratch

I'll push full project setups **after** all 10 experiments are done — not before.
Because who has time to keep git commits perfect while trying to not fail internals?

## 📚 Course Outcomes (Straight from the syllabus gods):

- **CO1:** Understand how Angular even works
- **CO2:** Build components/templates that *look* functional
- **CO3:** Make single-page apps that don’t crash (much)
- **CO4:** Talk to a server and get *some* kind of data
- **CO5:** Use or fake some libraries like a good dev

## 🔬 Experiments Dumped (as `.txt` files):

1. Knowing the Editor
2. Implementing Components
3. Implementing Templates
4. Creating Routing Applications
5. Displaying a List
6. Adding Services
7. Adding Navigation
8. Getting Data from a Server
9. Using Published Libraries
10. Creating Custom Libraries

Extras will be added whenever I’m bored or forced to.

## ✍️ Final Notes (Because Someone Might Still Ask)

- This is my code **documentation vault**, not a bootcamp.
- If you can read code, you can use it.
- If you can’t... this repo won’t save you.
- Internal? External? Just show this as your reference doc, and you might walk out alive.
- Pushes are random, just like Angular errors.
